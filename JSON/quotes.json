I don't know if there was anyone else in my cohort that worked longer hours or was more dedicated than Dave was. He was always cheerful and was a great sounding-board for me. He was a joy to work with. I know of (and fully endorse) Dave's design and coding skills. I have no qualms throwing big and complex problems his way. He constantly impressed me. I would love to work with Dave again.",
